# Hacktoberfest
I created a simple website to fetch all contributors of hacktoberfest. Check it out here: https://niklasschmitt.github.io/hacktoberfest

# Joining the list
To join to the list of contributors you just need to do this simple steps:
1. Fork this project
2. Edit `index.html` and add your username & href to your github-profile. Please use this format:

  `<a href="https://github.com/NiklasSchmitt" target="_blank">NiklasSchmitt</a>`

3. Commit your changes
4. Create a new PR

Happy hacking!
